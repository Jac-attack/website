        <p class="text-left mt-4">There are so many things about me that I could tell you. I'm a mom and wife and have helped a family grow their own baby. I have a lot of expertise in the field of social work regarding autism, human behavior, and child trauma. I came to Canada to work on a PhD in social work but got burned out.</p><br>
        <p class="text-left mt-4"> The things I did for the PhD did point me in a new direction, though. I absolutely love working with data and finding patterns and using those patterns to make data-driven decisions. I also was privileged enough to study neurocience at the PhD level and I love teaching students about how the brain works.</p><br>
        <p class="text-left mt-4"> I am now focusing hard on learning how to code, starting with Python. I would like to do a major career pivot from social work to data science, machine learning, and AI. My background in research and analyzing data coupled with my knowedge of how the brain works (machine learning works quite similary to the brain) is an excellent foundation for the field.</p>
