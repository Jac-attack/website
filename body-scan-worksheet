Body Scan Worksheet

1. Pre-Scan Check-In:
Before you begin the body scan, take a moment to check in with yourself and assess your current state.
•	How do you feel right now (emotionally and physically)? Write a few words about how you’re feeling—e.g., stressed, tired, calm, etc.
•	On a scale of 1-10, how relaxed or tense do you feel right now?
(1 = very tense, 10 = very relaxed)
___/10

2. Body Scan Exercise:
Find a quiet, comfortable space where you can sit or lie down. Take a few deep breaths to center yourself.
•	Start with your feet:
Close your eyes and bring your attention to your feet. Notice any sensations in your toes, the soles of your feet, and your ankles. Are they tense, relaxed, warm, cool, or neutral?
Take a deep breath into your feet and release any tension as you exhale.
•	Move up your body: Now, move your awareness up to your calves, knees, thighs, and hips. Spend a moment noticing any sensations. Are there any areas of discomfort or relaxation?
Breathe into those areas and release any tension as you exhale.
Repeat this process, slowly moving upward through your body:
o	Lower back and abdomen
o	Chest and upper back
o	Shoulders (pay attention to tension here)
o	Arms, hands, and fingers
o	Neck and throat
o	Face (eyes, jaw, mouth)
o	Scalp and head
For each area:
•	What sensations do you notice? (e.g., warmth, tingling, tightness)
•	What’s your level of comfort in that area? (e.g., relaxed, tense, neutral)
•	If you feel tension, try to consciously relax that part of your body as you exhale.

3. Post-Scan Check-In:
Once you've scanned your entire body, check in with yourself again.
•	How do you feel emotionally now?
Write a few words—e.g., calmer, more focused, less anxious, etc.
•	On a scale of 1-10, how relaxed or tense do you feel now?
(1 = very tense, 10 = very relaxed)
___/10




4. Reflection:
•	What areas of your body tend to hold the most tension?
Write down any areas that you noticed felt tight or uncomfortable (e.g., shoulders, jaw, lower back).
•	What can you do to care for or relax these areas in your daily routine?
Think of strategies to release tension, such as stretching, deep breathing, or taking regular breaks.
•	Did you notice any changes in how your body felt after completing the scan?
Write your thoughts here. Did you feel lighter, more relaxed, or more aware of your body?

5. Integration into Daily Life:
•	How can you incorporate body awareness into your routine?
Consider how you can check in with your body throughout the day, such as before or after stressful situations, during breaks, or before bed.
•	Would you like to try this exercise regularly?
Note if you'd like to practice the body scan daily, a few times a week, or whenever you feel stressed.

Quick Tips for Body Scan Practice:
•	Consistency is key: Try practicing the body scan at the same time each day or when you need it most (such as before exams, after a stressful class, or before sleep).
•	Use a guided version: If you’re new to the practice, you can follow along with a guided body scan video or audio (many apps and websites offer these).
•	Breathe deeply: Focus on slow, deep breathing throughout the body scan to help activate the relaxation response.

Optional Reflection Journal:
You can use this space for any additional thoughts, emotions, or insights that come up during or after your body scan practice. Feel free to write freely about your experience, how the exercise felt, or any changes you noticed in your body or mood.
